## Purpose

The purpose of this course is to create a two-sided marketplace that connects users to each other, allowing them to buy and sell books between them. A lot of students are required to buy extremely expensive books for different subjects and after the term on that subject will no longer have a use for them ever again. Some people who read as a hobby can only read the same book so many times before they no longer get any value out of reading the same book again. This app will provide these people a way for them to properly buy and sell these books.

## Functionality

This app is a simple marketplace app allowing users to create listings of books they would like to sell as well as see other users listing of books they are selling. They will be able to sell books to other users as well as buy them from other users as well. There is also a rating system that will allow users to rate the books that are being sold so that other users can better determine the quality or likelihood of them enjoying the book based on the userbase opinion of it. Users will have to be logged in to user the app in any capacity and admins will have higher levels of control than users e.g. deleting other users posts.

## Planning

Planning was short and sweet. I mapped out the things I needed to accomplish in a short time on a notebook and on Trello. I already knew what I needed to make and I just needed to lay out a short and sweet plan to check off tasks as I completed them.

User stories are included on the trello board.

## Target Audience 

The audience for this app will be any avid book readers looking to buy a pre-loved book to use or to sell a book they no longer want or need. This could be anyone from high-school students looking to buy or get rid of mandatory reading books, university students looking to sell textbooks no longer required for their course or on the flip side, students looking to buy required textbooks on the cheap rather than the inflated normal price. It also could appeal to older audiences who read for the love of it and would like to buy a new favourite or part with a book they no longer wish to read.
